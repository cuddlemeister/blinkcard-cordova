# BlinkCard SDK wrapper for Cordova

This repository contains wrapper for BlinkCard native SDKs ([iOS](https://github.com/blinkcard/blinkcard-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/blinkcard/blinkcard-android)). Not all features of native SDKs are available in PhoneGap wrapper. However, the wrapper is open source, so you can easily add features that you need. For 100% of features and maximum control, consider using native SDKs.

Please note, that current repository is a fork of this [BlinkID Repo](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-cordova/). It was rewritten to support functionality of BlinkCard, that was removed from _blinkid-cordova_ starting from V5. All the functionality of BlinkID was removed.

## Cordova version
BlinkCard requires Cordova **v7.0.0 or later** and cordova-android plugin **v7.0.0 or later**.

## Ionic version

Latest version has been tested using Ionic **3.19.0** version.
